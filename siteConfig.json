                "answer": "A car loan is a type of installment financing where a lender provides funds to purchase a vehicle, which you repay over a set period with interest. The vehicle typically serves as collateral for the loan. Once you've paid off the balance in full, you hold clear title to the car."
              },
              {
                "question": "Who is eligible to apply for a DriveRate Auto Loan?",
                "answer": "Most U.S. residents who are at least 18 years old with verifiable income and a valid government-issued ID are eligible to apply. We work with a broad range of credit profiles, so don't be discouraged if your credit history isn't perfect. Our goal is to find a financing path that works for your situation."

                "question": "Can I finance both new and used vehicles?",
                "answer": "Yes — DriveRate Auto Loans supports financing for new, used, and certified pre-owned vehicles. Loan terms and available rates may vary depending on the age and mileage of the vehicle. Our team can help you understand the best options based on the car you have in mind."
              },
              {
                "question": "Does applying affect my credit score?",
                "answer": "Our initial pre-qualification process uses a soft credit inquiry, which does not impact your credit score. A hard inquiry is only performed when you formally accept a loan offer and proceed with full application. We believe you should be able to explore your options with confidence."
              },

                "question": "Can I refinance my existing car loan through DriveRate?",
                "answer": "Absolutely. If your current auto loan has a high interest rate or unfavorable terms, refinancing through DriveRate may help you secure a lower rate or reduce your monthly payment. The process is similar to applying for a new loan — quick, straightforward, and entirely online."

              {
                "question": "What factors determine my interest rate?",
                "answer": "Your interest rate is influenced by several factors including your credit score, loan term length, the vehicle's age, your debt-to-income ratio, and current market conditions. Borrowers with stronger credit profiles typically qualify for the most competitive rates. We're transparent about how these factors affect your offer so there are no surprises."
              },
              {
                "question": "What loan term lengths are available?",
                "answer": "DriveRate offers flexible loan terms to fit your budget and timeline. Shorter terms generally mean higher monthly payments but less interest paid overall, while longer terms spread costs out but may accrue more interest. We'll help you compare options so you can choose the term that aligns with your financial goals."
              },
              {
                "question": "Is my interest rate fixed or variable?",
                "answer": "All DriveRate Auto Loans come with fixed interest rates, meaning your rate and monthly payment remain consistent for the life of the loan. This gives you predictable payments and makes budgeting straightforward. You'll always know exactly what you owe each month."
              },
              {
                "question": "Is there a minimum or maximum loan amount?",

Minimum and maximum amounts may vary based on your credit profile and the vehicle you're financing. Contact our team for specifics based on your needs."

                "question": "Are there any prepayment penalties if I pay off my loan early?",
                "answer": "No — DriveRate does not charge prepayment penalties. You're free to make additional payments or pay off your loan in full ahead of schedule at any time. Paying early can reduce the total interest you pay over the life of the loan."

Having these ready in advance can speed up the review process significantly."
              },

                "question": "How long does the approval process take?",

Full approval and final loan documentation may take a short additional period depending on verification requirements. We keep you informed every step of the way so you're never left waiting in the dark."
              },
              {
                "question": "What happens after I'm approved?",
                "answer": "Once approved, you'll review and sign your loan agreement digitally. Funds are then coordinated directly with the dealership or seller, depending on your purchase situation. The process is designed to be as smooth as possible so you can focus on driving your new vehicle home."

Your credit score is one of many factors we consider, and we work to find solutions rather than simply decline applications. Reaching out to our team can help clarify what options may be available to you."
